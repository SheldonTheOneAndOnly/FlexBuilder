# FlexBuilder
A drag-and-drop application for defining VTA flexes!

## How does it work?
You will need:
- A VTA file
- FlexBuilder

1. You drag and drop the VTA file into FlexBuilder (.exe file)
2. The command prompt will show you how many flexes you have and what you'd like to call them. Write what you'd like to call them, but **do not use spaces.**
3. After that, it will generate a .txt file which contains the code that can be used to implement the flexes your model has. Copy and paste that to a QC of a model that has the .vta file.

Simple as.
